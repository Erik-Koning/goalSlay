Proxy
Good to know: Starting with Next.js 16, Middleware is now called Proxy to better reflect its purpose. The functionality remains the same.

Proxy allows you to run code before a request is completed. Then, based on the incoming request, you can modify the response by rewriting, redirecting, modifying the request or response headers, or responding directly.
